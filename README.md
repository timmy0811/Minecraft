# Mineclone
Watch a full fletched Minecraft clone evolving. Using modern OpenGL and other technologies for efficient rendering, this project is my largest and most complex so far. I hope you enjoy!

The Game features:
* Dynamic Terrain Generation using Perlin Noise
* Multithreaded Chunk Loading depending on the players position
* Highly custonizable YAML-Config
* Advanced Player Collision
* Skybox/Cubemap rendering
* Transparent Blocks such as Glass
* Advanced Debugging Statistics and Tools
* Texture Packer for generation Sprite Sheets
